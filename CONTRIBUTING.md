# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in `chakra-react-select`! All forms of contribution are
welcome, from issue reports to PRs and documentation / write-ups.

Before you open a PR:

- In development, run `npm run install:all` to setup the dependencies for the
  core package and the demo.
- Run `npm run dev` to build (and watch) the package source, as well as run the
  demo project which can be viewed at http://localhost:5152.
- Please ensure all the examples work correctly after your change.
- Also run `npm run lint` to ensure that the change meets the projects code
  style setup.
- Make sure there's an issue open for any work you take on and intend to submit
  as a pull request - it helps core members review your concept and direction
  early and is a good way to discuss what you're planning to do.
- If you open an issue and are interested in working on a fix, please let us
  know. We'll help you get started, rather than inadvertently doubling up on
  your hard work.
- All new features and changes need documentation. If you don't have time to
  write any, leave a note in your PR.
